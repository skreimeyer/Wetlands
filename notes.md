# Notes from phone conversations with D Ivanoff and M Sees

## Delia Ivanoff w/ South Florida Water Management District

FL started constructing wetlands in the 1990s (up to 18,000 acres).
CW work well if sized properly
CW absorb phosphates and settle cations. Microbes can improve this.
Plants (rushes and aquatic veg) can uptake the nutrient loads.
Everglades basin reduces phosphates 85%. 100-200ppb intake -> 20ppb outlet
Primary use is for managing agricultural runoff (SFWMD).
Palm Beach County uses CW as tertiary effluent treatment & storage (I think PHX too)

Challenges:
- sizing
- loading rate
- weather (storms can destroy vegetation)
- turbidity (slows regrowth)
- nesting animals can block control structures
- vegetation can be "finicky". Species thrive in different depths, flow-rates. Drowning/dessication a threat

O&M:
- Orlando Easterly Wetlands:
- Requires controlled burns & dredging
- Maintenance of pumps and gates

## Mark Sees w/ Orlando Easterly Wetlands

Basics:
  - 1650 acres
  - 1200 acres wetland
  - $21.5M to construct ($60M today)
  - 35MGD capacity
  
CW handle about 21,000 gal/acre or ~ 1/2 gal/sqft
Mark Sees is wetland designer
Lagoons useful for managing overflows
OEW expected to handle 10-15MGD, but has increased cap to 35MGD
Iron Bridge has a capacity of 24MGD, supports 40K people
CLR probably requires about 12MGD up to 25MGD
Approximately 400-600 acres could meet the demand
Reservoir would be necessary to feedback to the Tx plant
Increasing detention time increases the amount of materials removed
Coliforms and pharmaceuticals can be reduced
Berms w/i tx cells are separated with a clay liner
Reclaimed area, installed berms and then flooded the tx site.
Holds 2.2M plants, 60M species of animals(?)

O&M:
  - controlled burns and mucking
  - high phosphate content
  - bioaccumulation can cause re-release during decay
  - replant and re-flood
  - drying out recommended
  - water may be released for irrigation
  
some CW pump in water and do no maintenance.
OEW has 5 staff (maintenance and tours)
Wakoodahapche has about 10K toursists/year
Total program cost is $750K/year
